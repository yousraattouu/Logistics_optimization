Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a type of machine learning technique where an agent learns to make decisions by 
interacting with an environment. The agent learns from the consequences of its actions, receiving feedback in the form 
of rewards or penalties. The objective in reinforcement learning is for the agent to learn a policy, which is a mapping
from states to actions, that maximizes the cumulative reward over time.

Key components of reinforcement learning include:

Agent: The entity that interacts with the environment and makes decisions.

Environment: The external system with which the agent interacts. It provides feedback to the agent in response to its actions.

State: A representation of the current situation or condition of the environment.

Action: A decision or choice made by the agent, which affects the environment.

Reward: Feedback provided by the environment to the agent after it takes an action. The reward signal guides
the agent towards desirable behaviors.

"In such scenarios, such as the Traveling Salesman Problem, several solutions are conceivable, including brute-force or
heuristic approaches. The objective here was to demonstrate the use of Reinforcement Learning, especially when the cost
function between two points is stochastic. Furthermore, this presents a different approach using an algorithm tailored 
for real-time systems, which continuously enhances strategies over time towards optimal performance."
